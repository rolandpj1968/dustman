# Collection semantics

This document captures the invariants, state machine, and failure modes of dustman's collection subsystem. It grows with each phase; today it covers phase 2 (stop-the-world mark-sweep, single mutator). Later phases extend rather than replace.

## State machine

Three states, driven by `dustman::collect()`:

```
idle ──collect()──▶ marking ──worklist drained──▶ sweeping ──reclaim done──▶ idle
```

Phase 2 is stop-the-world on a single mutator thread: `collect()` runs synchronously and returns with `gc_state == idle`. Phase 2b (this step) implements the transition `idle → marking → idle` — the sweep phase is a no-op for now and lands in phase 2c.

## Invariants

**Before `collect()`:** `gc_state == idle`. Mark bits may carry stale state from the previous cycle; they are cleared on entry.

**After mark phase completes:** an object's mark bit is `1` iff the object is reachable from some registered `Root<T>` by following `Tracer<T>::trace` calls. No other objects are marked.

**During marking:** the mark worklist contains objects that are marked-but-not-yet-traced. `MarkVisitor::visit` skips already-marked objects, which makes the algorithm cycle-safe and lineary-bounded in the number of live objects.

**During `collect()`:** the reentrancy guard (thread-local `collecting_`) is set. `alloc<T>` asserts it is clear and aborts otherwise. `collect()` itself asserts it is clear on entry.

**After `collect()`:** `gc_state == idle`. The reentrancy guard is cleared. Mark bits reflect the reachability snapshot captured during the cycle.

## Failure modes and how we catch them

| # | Failure | Effect | Detection |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Tracer omits a `gc_ptr<T>` field | Reachable object unmarked; freed by sweep; silent UAF later | Stress mode (collect-on-every-alloc, scheduled to land with sweep) surfaces it at first access. A negative test with a deliberately-buggy tracer proves the mechanism detects omissions. |
| 2 | Allocation during `collect()` (tracer allocates, for example) | New object untracked; state machine corruption | Reentrancy guard: `alloc<T>` aborts if `collecting_` is set. |
| 3 | Reentrant `collect()` | State machine corruption | Same reentrancy guard; aborts on entry. |
| 4 | Slot arithmetic wrong | Mark bits set for the wrong slot | Round-trip tests: alloc, collect, `is_marked(p)` agrees with expected reachability. |
| 5 | Cycle in the object graph | Infinite loop during marking | `MarkVisitor` checks the mark bit before queueing; already-marked objects are skipped. |

## Consumer contract (phase 2)

- All GC-managed references outside the heap live in `Root<T>`. A stack-local `gc_ptr<T>` is not a root; its pointee may be collected.
- Tracers visit every `gc_ptr<T>` field of their type. `FieldList<T, ...>` handles the common case without hand-written bookkeeping.
- Tracers must not allocate.
- `collect()` must not be called from within another `collect()` or from a tracer.

Runtime-detectable violations of this contract abort.
